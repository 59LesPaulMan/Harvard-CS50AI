# Harvard CS50: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

![CS50AI Certificate](CS50AI.png)

Welcome to my project portfolio for [HarvardX CS50AI](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/), an intensive, project-based course exploring the foundational concepts behind artificial intelligence and machine learning using Python.

---

## üß† Course Overview

This course introduced key AI topics including:

- **Search algorithms** (e.g., BFS, DFS)
- **Knowledge representation and logic**
- **Bayesian networks**
- **Machine learning** (scikit-learn)
- **Natural language processing**
- **Neural networks** (TensorFlow)
- **Reinforcement learning** (Q-learning)
- **Attention and Transformers**

Each project reinforced a specific domain through practical application and implementation in Python.
